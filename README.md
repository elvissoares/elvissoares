### Hi there, I'm Elvis 👋


I’m a Professor of Molecular Engineering at Chemical Engineering Program [(PEQ/COPPE)](http://www.peq.coppe.ufrj.br/global/index.php/en/) at UFRJ, Brazil 🇧🇷. My research is related to the [ATOMS](http://atoms.peq.coppe.ufrj.br/en/index.html)/UFRJ group. I'm interested in Soft Matter from the Computational point of view with focus on Density Functional Theory, Molecular Simulation, Theory of Liquids, Electrolyte Solutions, Colloidal systems and mechanisms of Pattern Formation.
